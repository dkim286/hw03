# `hw03/cpp`

This folder contains the C++ implementation of the homework. It *should* be working, more or less.

## Building

```text
$ g++ -pthread *.h *.cpp -o stack-ptr
```

## Usage

It's the same as the C version:

```text
$ ./stack-ptr [OPTION]
```

Reference the README.md in the project root directory for details.
